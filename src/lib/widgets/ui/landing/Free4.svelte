                    <p>All our solutions are designed and built to help reduce maintenance costs and efforts for sports ground, greens and spaces. For sand we let maintenance crews wash it instead of replacing it with the help of our Capillary Wash Box.</p>

                    <h4>Reduction of fertilizers and pesticides</h4>
                    <p>The drainage CapillaryFlow solutions offer help avoid waterlogged surfaces, making grass less prone to diseases and fungicide. Hence, less harmful pesticides need to be used. <br>
                      <br>By irrigating the surface from below, water consumption is reduced with up to 90 %. Distributing fertilizers and pesticides through the subsurface irrigation system avoids leaching of it into adjacent soil and land.

                    <h4>Significantly reduced maintenance</h4>
                    <p>The Capillary Hydroponics grows stronger grass that needs less verticutting and slitting, deep loosening and core aeration and mowing, and there are no costly replacements or maintenance of sand-clogged irrigation and drainage systems. <br>
                      <br>Sand bunkers and horse arenas wonâ€™t have to be irrigated or spot raked and no particles will migrate into the drainage system.
